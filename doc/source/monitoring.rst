Monitoring view
===============

.. image:: _static/monitoring.png


DjangoFloor provides a view to check if everything is ok or to debug if something is wrong.
This view is made of several widgets:

  * :class:`djangofloor.views.monitoring.RequestCheck`: some infos on the HTTP request (server name, whether if websockets are working, request headers, â€¦),
  * :class:`djangofloor.views.monitoring.System`: system stats like CPU/mem/disk usage,
  * :class:`djangofloor.views.monitoring.CeleryStats`: show Celery info like the connected workers and queues,
  * :class:`djangofloor.views.monitoring.Packages`: show required and installed Python packages,
  * :class:`djangofloor.views.monitoring.AuthenticationCheck`: show active authentication methods,
  * :class:`djangofloor.views.monitoring.LogAndExceptionCheck`: raise exceptions or write some log lines,
  * :class:`djangofloor.views.monitoring.LogLastLines`: last lines of logs.

The list of widgets is defined in `settings.DF_SYSTEM_CHECKS`, so you can change the list of widgets. By default, this view is limited to superusers.
You can easily disable this view by setting `settings.DF_SYSTEM_CHECKS` to an empty list.
By default, this view is accessible on `/df/monitoring/system_state/` or through the admin index.
